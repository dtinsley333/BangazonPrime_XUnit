TDD examples for Bangazon Prime

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development

###This code is an simple TDD example. 
MAIN TDD STEPS (Red to Green Tests):
   1. Write the test prior to writing code.
   2. Run all tests and see if the new test fails
   3. Write the code to satisfy the test
   4. Run tests, refactor and fix until the test passes
   5. Refactor, clean up refine, make sure you are meeting acceptance criteria
   6. Repeat 

A few of the tests work already, some don't.

1. Fix the current tests that don't work by creating code that turns the red broken test to green passing tests. 
2. Create tests for allowing sellers to create products that are Bangazon Prime.
3. Add test to test that a product of the type holiday movie is eligible for Bangazon prime from October to January. User must also have a 
   Bangazon Prime Membership.
4. Create a test that test that users without Bangazon Prime are offered Bangazon Prime at a discount on Black Friday.
